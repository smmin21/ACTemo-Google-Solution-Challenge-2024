## 💡 Introduction
**ACTemo** is ~.

<br>

## 🤖 Demo Video

<br>

## 🔮 Features
**ACTemo** offers two distinct features, each tailored to enhance emotional recognition and expression:
#### `1` READemo
**READemo** harnesses the power of natural language processing to analyze user-written diary entries. With the `Gemini` API, it accurately identifies the user's current emotional state. This insight serves as the foundation for subsequent exercises in understanding and expressing emotions.

#### `2` ACTion
**ACTion** takes user engagement a step further by focusing on vocal expression. Users are provided with scripts designed to evoke specific emotions, enabling them to practice emotive delivery. Utilizing a custom PyTorch model, `speech-emotion-evaluation model` analyzes the nuances of user speech, including pitch, tone, and cadence. Users receive real-time feedback on their emotional delivery, enabling them to refine their ability to recognize and express emotions effectively.

These features work in tandem to provide users with a comprehensive platform for honing their emotional recognition and expression capabilities.

<br>

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Upon completion of these processes, users earn `Emotion Cards` as a reward, providing motivation and acknowledgment of their progress in emotional expression proficiency.

## 🛠 Project Architecture
> [!NOTE]
> This architecture enables **ACTemo** to provide users with an enhanced experience in emotional recognition and expression.


![Project Architecture](https://github.com/smmin21/ACTemo-Google-Solution-Challenge-2024/assets/79392773/2829819b-5b76-42ee-b30d-c36e3e94bdec)

Our app, **ACTemo**, is built on `Flutter` and leverages `Firebase`. It comprises two core features:

- **READemo**: This component analyzes textual diary entries using the `Gemini` API to understand the user's emotional state.
    
- **ACTion**: Powered by custom PyTorch models, `speech-emotion-evaluation model` analyzes user speech to gauge emotional expression, focusing on aspects like pitch and tone.
    

The AI models behind **ACTemo** are hosted on `Google Cloud Platform`, ensuring scalability and performance. Additionally, `Cloud Build` facilitates continuous integration and deployment, streamlining the development process.
